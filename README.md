## Introduction

BrainWave is the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, pretrained on more than 40,000 hours of electrical brain recordings (13.79 TB of data) from approximately 16,000 individuals. BrainWave outperforms other competing models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the diagnosis and identification of neurological disorders.
